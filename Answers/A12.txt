Title: Investigating the Impact of Microplastic Pollution on Soil Biota and Plant Growth in Agricultural Ecosystems

Abstract:

Microplastic pollution has become a pressing environmental concern, with numerous studies highlighting its negative effects on aquatic ecosystems. However, the impact of microplastics on terrestrial ecosystems, particularly agricultural soils, remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of microplastic pollution on soil biota and plant growth in agricultural systems.

A 2-year field experiment was conducted in a temperate grassland ecosystem, where microplastics (polyethylene and polypropylene) were introduced into the soil at varying concentrations. Soil samples were collected from six different treatment groups: (1) control, (2) low concentration (<10 μg/g), (3) moderate concentration (10-100 μg/g), (4) high concentration (>100 μg/g), and five replicates of each treatment. Soil biota, including bacteria, fungi, and nematodes, were quantified using high-throughput sequencing and traditional morphological methods.

Plant growth parameters, such as shoot length, root biomass, and chlorophyll content, were measured in the experimental plots. Statistical analysis was performed to determine significant differences among treatment groups.

Our results showed that microplastic pollution significantly affected soil biota, with increased abundance of certain bacterial species and reduced diversity. Plant growth parameters also demonstrated a dose-dependent response to microplastic exposure, with higher concentrations leading to decreased shoot length, root biomass, and chlorophyll content.

This study highlights the need for further research on the impact of microplastic pollution on terrestrial ecosystems, particularly agricultural systems. Our findings have implications for soil health management and sustainable agriculture practices in the face of increasing microplastic pollution.
