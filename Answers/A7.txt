In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest stirs, and night's awake.
The trees, like sentinels of old,
Stand guard, their leaves a whispered tale to unfold.

The wind whispers secrets through the boughs,
As moonlight filters, silver glows.
A nightingale's lament echoes deep,
A melancholy serenade, in slumber's keep.

In this green world, where life abounds,
The creatures stir, with sounds around.
The rustling leaves, a squirrel's flight,
A rabbit's leap, beneath the starry light.

The river flows, a winding course,
Reflecting skies, in mirrored force.
Its waters dance, to melody free,
A symphony of nature, wild and carefree.

As dawn breaks forth, with rosy hue,
The forest awakens, new and true.
The sun's warm touch, banishes the night,
And all around, life bursts into sight.

The world is full, of beauty rare,
In every place, a wonder to share.
So let us cherish, this earth we call home,
And honor nature, in its gentle tone.
