In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
Trees stand tall, their leafy boughs aglow,
A soothing melody that only nature knows.

The wind stirs soft, a gentle breeze that blows,
And rustles leaves, a symphony that flows.
The earthy scent of dampened soil does rise,
As petals fall, like tears from morning skies.

In hidden streams, where sunlight filters through,
Fish swim and dance, with secrets anew.
Their scales glimmer bright, like jewels rare,
Reflecting sunbeams, without a single care.

Above the treetops, clouds drift by,
A canvas of white, against the cerulean sky.
The sun's warm touch, a golden glow does bring,
And all around, life bursts forth in joyous ring.

As twilight deepens, and the stars appear,
The night air whispers lullabies so dear.
The world is hushed, in quiet reverie,
A time for dreams, when nature's symphony.

So let us breathe, the scent of blooms so sweet,
And listen close, to nature's gentle beat.
For in her rhythms, we find our own,
A harmony that soothes, and makes us whole.
